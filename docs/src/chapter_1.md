## Genre
`Top-Down` `Twin-stick` shooters are a subgenre of action video games that feature a top-down perspective and a unique control scheme using two analog sticks or similar input devices. One stick controls the character's movement, while the other stick independently controls the direction of shooting. This setup allows for simultaneous, multidirectional movement and aiming, providing fast-paced gameplay and demanding precise coordination. Twin-stick shooters often include various power-ups, multiple enemy types, and increasingly challenging levels, requiring players to strategize and adapt to survive in a dynamic, action-packed environment.
