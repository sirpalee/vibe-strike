When writing your Game Design Document, keep the following tips in mind:

Be concise: Clearly communicate your ideas without using unnecessary jargon or overly complex language.
Stay organized: Structure your document logically, with headings and subheadings for easy navigation.
Iterate: Update and refine your GDD as your game evolves throughout the development process.
Get feedback: Share your GDD with team members or peers to gather input and ensure that your ideas are clearly conveyed and well-received.

A well-crafted GDD will serve as a valuable reference throughout the development process, ensuring that everyone on the team has a shared understanding of the game's vision and goals.
