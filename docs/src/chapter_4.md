# Story and Narrative

## Setting

### Time Period

`AI Strike` takes place in the early 1990s, during the Bush/Clinton era, not long after the Gulf War. The geopolitical landscape is marked by the aftermath of the war and the subsequent power vacuum, as well as the ongoing political changes in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

### Stage 1: Post-War Iraq

The first stage of `AI Strike` is set in post-war Iraq, where remnants of the Republican Guard have started a rebellion against the weakened government. These rogue military elements, though armed with low-tech equipment, pose a significant threat due to their familiarity with the local terrain and guerilla warfare tactics. Players are tasked with assisting allied forces in restoring order and preventing the situation from escalating into a full-scale conflict.

Missions in this stage will involve navigating the arid and unforgiving landscapes of Iraq, engaging in intense aerial combat with enemy forces, and dismantling the insurgents' military infrastructure. The player will face a variety of ground threats, such as convoys of armed vehicles, hidden anti-aircraft emplacements, and ambushes set up by skilled enemy combatants. Players will need to utilize their helicopter's agility and an array of onboard weaponry to neutralize these threats while avoiding collateral damage to civilian infrastructure.

Players must also support allied ground forces by providing aerial reconnaissance, close air support, and evacuating wounded personnel from the battlefield. In some missions, players will be tasked with escorting convoys of humanitarian aid, ensuring that supplies reach their intended destinations safely, despite the looming threat of insurgent attacks.

Throughout this stage, players will develop their piloting skills, learning to adapt their tactics to the unique challenges posed by low-tech, yet resourceful and determined enemies, all while navigating the harsh and treacherous terrain of post-war Iraq.

As the player delves deeper into Stage 1, it becomes apparent that the enemy combatants consist of well-trained members from the disbanded Republican Guard. These remnants of the former regime's elite military forces are highly skilled and deeply devoted to their mission of regaining control and power. Their unwavering loyalty and determination make them a considerable threat, as they refuse to surrender or back down from their objectives.

The player will encounter organized resistance, with enemy forces employing battle-hardened tactics and strategies they have honed during their time in the Republican Guard. These adversaries are adept at setting up ambushes, utilizing terrain to their advantage, and coordinating counterattacks, making each mission more challenging and intense.

Players must adapt to this tenacious enemy, developing new tactics and strategies to outsmart and outfight these battle-tested combatants. This will require careful reconnaissance, gathering intelligence on enemy movements and plans, and identifying weak points in their defenses.

In addition to engaging in high-intensity firefights, players will be tasked with cutting off supply lines, disrupting enemy communications, and eliminating high-value targets within the former Republican Guard's ranks. These missions will test the player's skill, resourcefulness, and courage as they face a determined and well-trained enemy, committed to their cause and prepared to fight to the bitter end.

### Stage 2: Eastern Europe

In the second stage of `AI Strike`, the player is sent to Eastern Europe, where political instability in the post-Soviet era has given rise to the Carpathian Sentinels, a dangerous paramilitary group seeking to regain control and secure Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs). The player uncovers a connection between the Carpathian Sentinels and a rogue Russian general named Nikolai Petrovich, who is supplying the group with potentially nuclear or chemical weapons, further escalating the situation.

Missions in this stage will immerse the player in diverse Eastern European landscapes, from dense forests to urban environments, where they must contend with heavily-armed enemies equipped with Soviet-era technologies. The player will face formidable adversaries, such as advanced AA batteries, T-72 tanks, various BMP Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs), and Soviet attack helicopters. The player's helicopter must navigate these hostile territories while engaging in aerial combat, outmaneuvering, and outgunning the enemies.

In addition to intense combat scenarios, players will be tasked with gathering intelligence on General Nikolai Petrovich and the Carpathian Sentinels' operations, dismantling their supply lines, and ultimately preventing the deployment of WMDs. Players will work alongside local resistance forces and international allies to thwart the paramilitary group's ambitions and bring General Petrovich to justice.

Throughout this stage, players will hone their skills against challenging foes equipped with Soviet-era technology, uncovering and dismantling a dangerous conspiracy that threatens the stability of the entire region.

As the player progresses through Stage 2, it becomes evident that the Carpathian Sentinels is not a typical paramilitary group. The organization is well-structured, and its members possess military backgrounds and training, making them formidable opponents. Their familiarity with Soviet-era tactics and equipment, combined with their discipline and coordination, significantly raises the stakes in each mission.

The Carpathian Sentinels' strategic capabilities and effective communication network allow them to coordinate ambushes, set up defensive perimeters, and launch counterattacks. Players will face a variety of challenging combat scenarios, including heavily fortified positions, well-coordinated assaults, and rapid response forces.

To succeed in this stage, players must adapt their tactics, employing a combination of stealth, precision, and speed to outwit and outmaneuver the Carpathian Sentinels. This will involve carefully assessing each situation, choosing the right moment to strike, and exploiting weaknesses in the enemy's defenses.

In addition to engaging in direct combat, players will be tasked with infiltrating enemy strongholds to gather crucial intelligence, sabotaging the group's infrastructure, and rescuing hostages or defectors who possess vital information on the Carpathian Sentinels and General Petrovich's plans. These high-stakes missions will test the player's skill, resourcefulness, and determination as they work to dismantle the well-organized and highly trained Carpathian Sentinels and put an end to their dangerous ambitions.

### Stage 3: Australia

In Stage 3, players find themselves battling the Outback Anarchists, a well-organized group of off-road enthusiasts, deep within the Australian wilderness. The game takes players through the rugged landscapes of Gippsland, High Country, and the Yarra Valley, where the Outback Anarchists excel in navigating the treacherous terrain.

The Outback Anarchists are skilled in traversing the unpredictable wilderness with ease, using their intimate knowledge of the terrain to launch surprise attacks from unexpected locations. Although their weaponry is not as advanced as the previous stages' adversaries, the group compensates with cunning tactics, street smarts, and a deep understanding of guerrilla warfare.

As players progress through Stage 3, they will be challenged to adapt to the unique environment and ever-changing conditions. The vast, open landscapes and rugged terrain will demand a new set of tactics, requiring players to utilize reconnaissance, stealth, and hit-and-run strategies to outmaneuver the Outback Anarchists.

In addition to engaging in intense firefights, players will be tasked with gathering intelligence on the group's plans, sabotaging their operations, and preventing them from executing their sinister plot to poison Victoria's water reserve. The player's success in these missions will rely on their ability to navigate the unforgiving terrain, adapt to the Outback Anarchists' unconventional tactics, and ultimately put an end to their reign of terror.
