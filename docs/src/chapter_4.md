# Story and Narrative

## Setting

### Time Period

`AI Strike` takes place in the early 1990s, during the Bush/Clinton era, not long after the Gulf War. The geopolitical landscape is marked by the aftermath of the war and the subsequent power vacuum, as well as the ongoing political changes in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

### Stage 1: Post-War Iraq

The first stage of the game is set in post-war Iraq, where remnants of the Republican Guard have started a rebellion against the weakened government. These rogue military elements, though armed with low-tech equipment, pose a significant threat due to their familiarity with the local terrain and guerilla warfare tactics. Players are tasked with assisting allied forces in restoring order and preventing the situation from escalating into a full-scale conflict.

Missions in this stage will involve navigating the arid and unforgiving landscapes of Iraq, engaging in intense aerial combat with enemy forces, and dismantling the insurgents' military infrastructure. The player will face a variety of ground threats, such as convoys of armed vehicles, hidden anti-aircraft emplacements, and ambushes set up by skilled enemy combatants. Players will need to utilize their helicopter's agility and an array of onboard weaponry to neutralize these threats while avoiding collateral damage to civilian infrastructure.

Players must also support allied ground forces by providing aerial reconnaissance, close air support, and evacuating wounded personnel from the battlefield. In some missions, players will be tasked with escorting convoys of humanitarian aid, ensuring that supplies reach their intended destinations safely, despite the looming threat of insurgent attacks.

Throughout this stage, players will develop their piloting skills, learning to adapt their tactics to the unique challenges posed by low-tech, yet resourceful and determined enemies, all while navigating the harsh and treacherous terrain of post-war Iraq.

### Stage 2: Eastern Europe

The second stage of `AI Strike` shifts the focus to Eastern Europe, where the political turmoil following the dissolution of the Soviet Union has given rise to paramilitary groups attempting to seize power and secure weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Players must work with local and international allies to neutralize these threats and prevent the dangerous weapons from falling into the wrong hands. Missions in this stage will include urban and rural environments, as well as a variety of weather conditions, requiring players to adapt their tactics and equipment to succeed in the ever-changing battlefield.

### Stage 3: Australia

The third stage of `AI Strike` takes the player to Australia, where a local terrorist group known as the Outback Anarchists has set its sights on poisoning Victoria's water reserve, posing a grave threat to the region's population and stability. Players must collaborate with Australian security forces to identify and neutralize the terrorists, safeguard the water reserve, and prevent any potential environmental catastrophes.

Missions in this stage will feature diverse landscapes, from the bustling cityscapes of Melbourne to the rugged wilderness of the Australian Outback. Players will face unique challenges as they pursue the Outback Anarchists, adapting to the varied terrains and employing specialized equipment to overcome the obstacles. Throughout this stage, players will unravel the group's motivations and connections, ultimately working to dismantle the organization and ensure the safety of the Australian people.
