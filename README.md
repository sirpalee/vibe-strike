# ai-strike
A spritual successor to the "Strike" series developed with the help of AI technologies

# Streaming schedule
Development of the project is streamed on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/sirpalee).

One one-hour slots starting Monday to Friday (Australia) at:
- 12PM AEDT / 6PM PDT

Real-life work and personal events can lead to fluctuations in a streaming schedule, as unexpected obligations and shifting priorities demand attention and flexibility.

# Goals

- Establish cutting-edge methodologies for leveraging AI tools in the development of compact, real-world projects.
- Assess the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to support development processes, including:
    - Auto-generation of code examples, streamlining access to relevant information.
    - Identification and troubleshooting of code issues and bugs.
    - Adherence to best-practice guidelines during development.
    - Enhancing code optimization.
    - Facilitating effective documentation authorship.
    - Evaluating the currency of popular LLM models.
    - Investigating LLM compatibility with emerging programming languages and modern practices in established ones.
- Harness AI for creative content generation, exploring:
    - 2D art creation through diffusion models.
    - Feasibility of 3D art generation.
    - Synthesis of NPC voice lines using machine learning models.
    - Viability of game music generation.
    - Utilization of ML models for procedural level design.
- Determine the extent to which AI serves as a "force-multiplier" for small teams or solo developers.

# Anti-Goals

- Avoid relying solely on AI for code development.
- Refrain from generating all assets exclusively through AI.

# Tech stack

- Chat GPT / Copilot (X) as the pair-programmer.
- Latest version of stable diffusion.
- Amazon polly for voices.
- Rust 2021.
- WGPU/WGSL.
- From scratch engine + ECS.

# Why

Projects utilizing LLMs and other AI tools for development purposes, particularly beyond the scope of generating basic applications and code, are relatively scarce. The objective of this project is to explore the application of LLMs in the context of more complex projects, where solutions may not be readily accessible through a simple online search. As we address increasingly specialized problems, the limitations of LLMs become more apparent. Our aim is to investigate the extent to which these tools can be employed effectively in less-than-ideal environments.
